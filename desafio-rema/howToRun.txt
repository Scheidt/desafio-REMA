4. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:3000

The application should now be running and accessible in your browser.

AVAILABLE SCRIPTS
=================

Development:
- npm run dev    - Start development server with Turbopack
- npm run build  - Build the application for production
- npm run start  - Start the production server
- npm run lint   - Run ESLint for code quality checks

PRODUCTION BUILD
================

To build the application for production:

1. Run the build command:
   npm run build

2. Start the production server:
   npm run start

3. The application will be available at:
   http://localhost:3000

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Common Issues:

1. Port 3000 already in use:
   - The development server will automatically use the next available port
   - Check the terminal output for the actual URL

2. Node.js version issues:
   - Ensure you have Node.js 18.0 or later installed
   - Check version with: node --version

3. Dependency installation fails:
   - Clear npm cache: npm cache clean --force
   - Delete node_modules folder and package-lock.json
   - Run npm install again

4. Application doesn't load:
   - Check that all dependencies are installed
   - Ensure the development server is running
   - Check browser console for any error messages

5. Excel file not loading:
   - Ensure RSLs_summaryTable.xlsx is in the public/ folder
   - Check browser network tab for 404 errors
